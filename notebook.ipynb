Firstly, the data needs to be validated according the the given criteria in the instructions. Looking at the columns one by one:\n\n- **product_id** is a unique identifier, hence, missing or duplicate values are not possible.\n- **category** column contained 25 missing values which were replaced with 'Unknown'. Other values were in the mentioned 6 types i.e. Housing, Food, Toys, Equipment, Medicine and Accessory.\n- **animal** contained no missing values and all data was of the 4 mentioned types namely : Cat, Dog, Bird, Fish.\n- **size** column had 3 types Small, Medium and Large but in a few places had inconsistent cases (eg. SMALL or small). Changed the case so that all three begin with a capital letter.\n- **price** column format was text originally so I transformed it to decimal number. It contained 150 unlisted data which were replaced with the overall median price (28.06) as mentioned. Also, I rounded off all values to two decimal places.\n-  **sales** column contained no missing values. Rounded off all values to two decimal places.\n-  **rating** contained 150 ratings with NA value. Replaced those with 0. Data type was text and was changed to whole number.\n-  **repeat_purchase** contained 0 or 1 with no missing values.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5265f161-863c-49ce-99dd-22156b95f839"},{"source":"## Task 2","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"The number of repeat purchases out of the given data is 906. From the following visualizations we can see that Equipment category has the most number of observations when plotted against sum of repeated purchases amounting to 221. We also see that the categories Medicine, Housing, Toys and Food have a comparable number of repeated purchases, whereas, Accessory has the least number out of the known categories.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"76b27db3-938a-4051-80f9-740fdaa8ed11"},{"source":"![Screenshot 2023-04-10 012449](Screenshot%202023-04-10%20012449.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d2425e0a-4080-433f-be4f-61c67c5a87e6"},{"source":"![Screenshot 2023-04-09 193620](Screenshot%202023-04-09%20193620.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dca3bd84-4357-402b-9166-5c262698d135"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"From the following visualization we can understand that sales values for most products lies between 878 and 1075. 437 products registered sales between 878 and 1075 followed by 338 products between range 681 and 878. Very few products have registered sales greater than 1468. There is a steady increase seen in the number of products as the sales value increases till 1075. Post that we see a steep drop in the number of products until it increases again.

For the purpose of this visualization, I transformed repeat_purchase column to only include the products that are repeatedly bought i.e. '1' value. From the following line and column chart we notice that sum of sales by category does not follow the same trend as repeat purchases by category. Equipment products have the highest number of repeat purchases. Much higher than the number of repeat purchases of Toys. Yet still, the sum of sales of Toys is only lesser than the sum of sales of Equipment by about 25k. Whereas, repeat purchases for Medicines is higher than Toys. Still, the total sales of medicines are lower than Toys.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"52e06048-efff-4b5f-b8e6-c931eb362c61"},{"source":"![Screenshot 2023-04-10 002808](Screenshot%202023-04-10%20002808.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"79bcaca5-49fc-47eb-88dd-111e954b8e5c"},{"source":"![Screenshot 2023-04-10 004556](Screenshot%202023-04-10%20004556.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a8e125d0-b00c-4a26-8b2b-5cdf28df7cec"},{"source":"This is due to the fact that the average selling amount of Toys is the highest. Evidently, Equipment is the most popular category and people tend to spend more on Toys on average. Thus, to increase sales, PetMind needs to apply their strategy of repeated purchases on luxury products rather than everyday products like food and medicine.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8e3a2553-9559-4914-bba0-fe79d6bfd55e"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
